# Surface-Bound-Odorant-Treadmill

One of the important subsets of odors sources used in olfactory navigation is surface-bound sources, which can broadly take the form of point sources or trails. Here, we present an automated treadmill design capable of dynamically printing odor trails of arbitrary lengths and configurations, and with closed-loop control of speed based on the animalâ€™s movement. This design is presented and the utility demonstrated in a corresponding paper studying surface-bound odor trail interactions in locusts (in submission).The uploaded design incorporates some improvements not reflected in the version used in the published paper (i.e. the modification of some components to reduce paper jams, and quality of life improvements).

The treadmill is comprised of a series of modules sequentially connected and mounted on an 80-20 frame enabling different slopes to be configured. The design of the mechanical components is provided as an .f3d file, openable using Fusion 360, which is available in [educational](https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/fusion-360-education), or [professional or free versions](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal/compare). 

In the file, the design is organized by modules, with the exception of the 'behavior chamber' and 'driver' modules, which are merged in the present design. The organizational structure is arranged to reflect all modules independently for any future revisions.

In addition to the mechanical components, the electrical PCB design files are provided in the form of a KiCAD project (KiCAD is open source and available here X), and the firmware and software to operate the treadmill, as well as matlab scripts for parsing generated data. Further details regarding each of these categories is provided below.
